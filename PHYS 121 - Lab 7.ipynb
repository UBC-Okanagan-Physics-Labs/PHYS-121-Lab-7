Along with the midterm and end-of-term Qualtrics surveys, these interviews are an integral part of our physics education research study. In a semi-structured interview, the interviewer follows a general outline of questions or topics to be covered, but may deviate from the original plan if new and interesting information arises.  The interest and thoughts of the interviewees will play a large role in guiding the direction of the discussion.\n",
    "\n",
    "These interviews will be conducted on a purely voluntary basis.  Whether or not you choose to volunteer will have no impact on your grade in PHYS 121. The structure, length, and date of the interviews will be contingent upon:\n",
    " - (a) the number of participants\n",
    " - (b) the preferences of those participants. \n",
    " \n",
    "The interviews will be conducted during the last three weeks of classes, are expected to take approximately 20 minutes, and may be performed individually or in groups.  The interviews will be recorded so that the discussions can be reviewed by the research team at a later date.  Any data extracted from the recordings will be anonymized and you will never be identified by name or student number. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you are interested in participating in these interviews, please enter your student number in the cell below.  At the same time, if you have any preferences regarding the structure, length, or date of the interview, please also include this information.  We will gladly do whatever we can to accommodate your preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you decide at a later date that you’d like to participate in the interviews, you can email either Jake Bobowski (jake.bobowski@ubc.ca) or Hiroko Nakahara (hiroko.nakahara@ubc.ca) with the subject line “PHYS 121 SSI”."
